# q1
# what is the value of ultimate after the following code executes?
# Remember to use operator precedence where applicable.
foo = 11
bar = 11 * 2
baz = 11 ** 2 + 7
foobar = foo + bar
qup = baz - 20 + foobar
ultimate = (foo * bar) + (foo ** 2) - 2
ultimate2 = foo * bar + foo ** 2 - 2

# the answer is 361

# q2
# What is the value of bat after the following code executes?
kax = 100
mar = kax // 7
rep = mar % 5 / float(2)
bat = kax / (rep + 1)
print(bat)
